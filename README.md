# FitoFit Client

## Configuration
- run <code>yarn && yarn start </code> and you should be good to go
- App by default sets API port to 4000 (see ./api/apiConfig.ts)
## Comments
The app implements basic interface to work with provided API.
There are some warinings, and some things may be not top-class code as the task is about my Rails skills.

I didn't use redux (some old-school action files instead), because the boilerplate whould be twice this app size. I'm missing types of some variables (not really good example of TypeScript coding).
